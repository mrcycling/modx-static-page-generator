CMS systems are great ways to keep websites up to date, but they all suffer from the same issue, it takes time to build the html document before it is sent to the browser.  Time which many web visitors are not willing to waste by waiting.

Vandergraaf-M is a static generator, static html that is.  It fetches pages from the CMS backend and then stores them as static files which the server sends out when requested by a browser.  Currently available for the MODX cms.
